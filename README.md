## 🧠 How It Works

Each quest is defined in a configuration file. When a player starts a quest, their current objective is shown on the BossBar. As progress is made, the BossBar updates in real time. Once a quest is completed, rewards are given and the next quest in the chain becomes available.

This system helps players clearly understand what they need to do next without cluttering the chat or screen.
